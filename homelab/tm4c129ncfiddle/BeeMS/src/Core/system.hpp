/*
 * corner stones of this project
 *  - this hardware is more replaceable than anything else
 *  - error resolution first, reporting second
 *  - explicit initialization of unused variables
 *  - don't care about on chip power consumption
 *
 * side notes
 *  - driverLib is linked to a pre-compiled CSS project, consider min-maxxing the optimizations on that.
